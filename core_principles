**Guidelines**
- Absolute statements are less helpful than relativities. We all try to do right. Our principles pertain to harder, nuanced choices.
- Principles change with experience. Just because something is true now doesn't make it a great idea next year.
- Difs are vital. If principles change with experience, as much can be learned from the changes as from the principle itself.
- A broken principle isn't a principle. If we contradict a principle we need to understand why and change the principle.
- Principles must be open. By exposing our thoughts, we invite our community to challenge us and help us grow.
- Guidelines change, too!

**Principles**
1. Smaller teams > Bigger teams, even if it requires better organization / occasional friction points.
2. Personal hours > Fixed hours, even if it requires a bit more communication.
3. Hire fewer folks pay them more > Hire more folks, pay them less, even if it means paying top salaries for the right talent.
4. Do it right > Do it fast, even if it means spending more time to get there - we can't go down.
5. Work on quiet problems > Work on loud problems, even if it means getting less attention / momentum from working on what's bright+shiny.
6. Being open > Being right, even if it means lots of noise
7. Our community > Our company, even if it means we have to make hard decisions for ourselves to benefit our customers
8. Be uncertain > Be directional, even if it means we are "unsure" about a lot, a lot of the time
